# MindfulWalk ‚≠ê

MindfulWalk is your companion for mindful exploration. This app encourages users to disconnect from the digital noise, step outside, and engage in a mindful walk through their city. It combines the benefits of walking, mindfulness, and discovery to promote mental well-being.

# MVP üèÜ

* User authentication: username, email, password
* Urban discovery map: integrate a map API to display points of interest; identify and curate locations for exploration such as parks, landmarks, etc.; implement interactive markers for points of interest 
* Step counter: utilize device sensors or integrate with fitness APIs for step counting; implement a distance tracker to show users how far they've walked
* Games: integrate achievements or rewards for completing challenges
* Photo diary: implement a feature to capture moments after walks; create a visual diary where users can store and review moments

# Stretch Goals ‚è≥

* Guided walks: plan audio content and randomized mindfulness prompts; select audio based on theme (rain, waterfalls, etc.)
* Community challenges: create leaderboards to encourage friendly competition and engagement
* Calorie counter (how many is being burned) 
* Trivia about the places that were visited 
* Journal prompt after their walk 
* Warning signs when walking 
* Being able to add friends 

# Milestones üöÄ

* Decide on tech stack
* Allow members to add and move the MVP/Stretch Goals as they like
* Team members decide who wants to do frontend, backend, or fullstack 
* Download IDEs, set up Git and make branches, commits, and pushes/pulls
* Share videos regarding tech stack to help guide team members
* Assign tasks to each team:
* Frontend:
    * Design initial wireframes, get feedback from outside opinions, and fix wireframes accordingly 
    * Code each page and fix accordingly 
    * Integrate depending on backend progress
    * Stretch goals
* Backend:
    * Learn user authentication and database
    * Code a dummy user account to store test information
    * Integrate map and fitness APIs to find a way to pull locations and steps
    * Integrate with frontend
    * Stretch goals
* Test app to see if live demo works
* Prepare for presentation night :)
